# ðŸŸ¢ Mean Squared Error

* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**This loss function is in the form of quadratic equation**</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**If we plot this loss vs weights then it will have only 1 global minima**</mark>
*   This curve is known as gradient descent

<mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Advantage:**</mark>

* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">MSE is differentiable</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">It has 1 local or global minima</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">It converges faster â‡’  coz we have smooth gradient descent</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Disadvantage:**</mark>

* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">Not robust to outliers â‡’  As we are squaring so becoz of this cost function will increase â‡’  We are penalizing the cost function â‡’  becoz of this our best fit line will get shifted</mark>
