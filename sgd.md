# SGD

* In SGD, we pass single record in each iteration
* We calculate loss function, and then do backward propagation

**Advantage:**

* Solves resource issue

**Disadvantage:**

* Time complexity increases
* Convergence takes time
* Noise gets introduced -> Since we are updating the weights based on a single record so it wont be a smooth convergence
